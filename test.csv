Seriously, with parking that protects you from rain and all aisles usually open, how can you not love this Target?  

Don't get me wrong, I am all about shopping local, but with 3 children that need a dump truck load of back-to-school supplies, Target is my choice.  And, seriously, where else can you pick up a cute top, scarf and set of sheets, while simultaneously loading up a cart with colored pencils, paper, and notebooks?  (And their junior dept. clothes, while tricky to find smaller sizes, are hard to distinguish from pricier brands... a huge bonus to this mother of a middle schooler).",0,OQT9DjfBrzrwOEdVJjuYIA
131,lJOGYkb8_n77ixVh_3zaug,0,2011-12-02,0,ssYFA8RHnSTnulzUgjotcA,3,"Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.",0,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

177,5PO5ZIHIcaTNIiHNoRKDqg,0,2012-06-21,1,r13Q1UVbPED1I-RRsbJDgw,1,"The Kensington Cornerstone offers a gluten free menu.  It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.

This past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.

It was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. 

Just when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and/or mojitos, and/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.

When our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.

So by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. 

(Sound of clock ticking)

Another half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. 

My mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.

Looking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. 

After we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA
134,sscP36MO34i5ep4QO8c7KA,1,2012-01-28,0,dp6rinVjRXYaAABTU6BYsA,3,"Sometimes I ride the 501 streetcar just for something to do.  It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.

At first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.

My girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  

As it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.

The quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. 

Food however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.

150,zZAAiNGU2ySMvAlYbvvchg,5,2011-02-19,3,VmfzZsWP9-fDlqWO4LgUFw,4,"La Passione is a dimly lit and intimately decorated restaurant on Yonge, just south of St. Clair, where you can get your fill of any and all your Italian favourites and a (huge) glass of wine.
Their extensive menu holds everything from Calamari Fritti, Insalata Arugula, Papparedelle al Salmone and Penna alla Vodka to Gnocchi with a choice of four sauces, Pollo alla Jolly (chicken in rose sauce) and Margherita pizza (a simple delight of mozzarella, olive oil and oregano).

La Passione balances the traditional with some modern comforts; you can peruse the thorough and interactive website and check out their Facebook page, then go and grab a classic white-clothed, candle-lit table and dip your focaccia in olive oil and balsamic before ordering gluten-free or whole wheat pasta.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting and, as I found out while waiting for my dinner guests who were running late, it is a very comfortable space to sit and relax with a glass of red.

From start to finish, it was delightful. For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.

I was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.

The veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.
And as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.

Personally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.

La Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Things didn't start out so good...the manager wanted all of us to pay cash because he didn't want to split the checks! After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. 

Moving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. 

Bottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.",0,dNNhk8urecrV_otn7kiziA

It still didn't win me over.  But this visit was better than before.

Our server was a bit weird, but ultimately helpful and friendly so that's all that matters. One of the other servers ""helping"" the table next to us was terrible and I'm glad we didn't have her. She seemed to be all attitude, and no help.

Brunch was great. I got the pancake platter, which comes with two pancakes of your choice, two vegan breakfast sausages and tofu scramble (for 12$). I could have done without the over-spiced boring tofu scramble, but the pancakes (banana-nut flavoured) were excellent, especially when slathered with margarine and dark rich maple syrup. Tofu sausage was fantastic.

I got an americano.  And while it wasn't a very big cup of coffee, or very caffeinated, it was very tasty.

I also ordered a side of soy yogurt, but really, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you get some jam. It's not flavoured with anything so when you order soy yogurt that's really all it is, and it's not very good.

Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeño to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away. 

If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. 

Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. 

The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. 

Complimentary salad was small cute and good. 

The miso soup was good. 

Tea was average. 

Ginger is really good here.

Wasabi is really weak here.

Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

110,iKMLsX1Je7P3wAOEc9scDg,0,2011-11-07,0,D2TcNaPqXxDGQ6T0n-vHXw,4,"I have been itching to get to Origin for months now after a friend of mine had gone and raved about the food. I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.

It was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.

Next up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.

Those scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.

Our next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.

Next up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.

Our final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.

Next up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!

Finally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.",4,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

129,TFftsYkRIUtdo6ZhRwJ2lQ,1,2011-10-25,1,070Mmij4jDIqLV-Cy5w7bw,4,"So lately I've been on a bit of an Italian kick. Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.
 
The camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. 

While (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). 

As for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  
  
Regardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. 

Our waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  

We started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. 
 
We chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.
 
No sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. 

Now when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Service was friendly - though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter (maybe it was shift change?) It's a very clean looking space, and I like the selection of vegan and gluten-free sweet treats, like stuff from Earth & City, Bunners Bake Shop, and Rawlly Delicious.

I ordered the ""First Canadian"" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.

They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.

Open from 8am to 5pm, they've got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless, wheatless, fare in the Financial District.

I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

The brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.

The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.

The thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.

People rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.

Make no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.

So would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

A former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.

Inside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...

This restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.

With that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.

Well to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.

A variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.

One benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.

Quite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Four Peaks isn't especially quiet, mind you.  They play pretty good music for the most part, and almost every time I've started to groan because of the song that just came on, someone who works there changes it.  The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.  

All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.

This place had been on my To-Try list for a while now. I came with three friends on a Saturday night when it was not too busy. I ordered the beef ribs ($16.50) with a side of potato salad ($4.00). My friends ordered the pork ribs ($16.00), along with a few appetizers.

What bothered me about the service was that they just sort of drop the food off at the table to no one in particular. Ideally, the server should place the dish in front of the specific person who ordered it, or at the very least ask, ""Okay who ordered the so-and-so?"" and place it in front of whoever answers. Also, delivery should be simultaneous. Two of my friends got their dish, and me and the fourth friend waited 15 minutes after that for ours.

For $16.50, I received TWO beef ribs with barely any meat on them. In my opinion, ribs should be fall-off-the-bone. These were the exact opposite, and the flavour was nothing special. My friend was even more disappointed with his pork ribs, and sent them back in exchange for the pulled-pork sandwich.

Dine in service is always friendly, and quick. Dishes are veganizable, there are lots of options, the food is always tasty and the portions are huge (we're eaters, but we still end up taking food home with us). The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly.

A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.

The food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?!

168,VSgrQWkpv15FJuqmNE3srg,1,2011-11-18,2,-WfxuhNncKIljj7ZssL2lw,3,"For the past year or so, I've been meaning to go to Mitzi's Cafe for brunch.  Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.

I love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.

And like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).

Sitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.

As I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange/banana/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.

The glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.

This would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Cream Horns-- seriously, the flakiest pastry shell, sprinkled with powdered sugar and filled full of the lightest, fluffiest frosting-like fill.  

Snickerdoodles-- cinnamon sugar yuminess on top of an elephant ear like cookie/pastry.  

Elephant Ears-- a huge treat that is as large as a 5 year old's head (really).

Sugar cookies-- all shapes and decorations, perfectly sweetened to be able to eat several without feeling ill!  --- They also make these to order--- perfect for school parties that require cookies for decorating and the mom who does not bake!

Cupcakes-- all different flavors.  Delicious and lovely.

Cakes-- Tizzerts.  Need I say more?  Just the best cake you can put in your mouth... Our wedding cake was Tizzerts, and have had several other special occasion cakes from Tiz.

Thumb print cookies--  perfect for the little bit of sweet tooth, a small sugar cookie/ shortbread like cookie, topped with a smudge of frosting (this is my go-to treat).

I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of my family.  So my go-to is the thumb print cookie but, even without a sweet tooth, the temptations of all this goodness cannot be resisted.   We celebrate milestones and accomplishments and hard days and completed projects by occasionally popping into Suarez and picking out a delectable treat.

More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun.

147,bEVWHtBRYVwqaaNF4mWNYg,1,2011-10-03,0,fPy3Kzbv0xXE78bhvh3gNQ,4,"Coquine Restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a European patio café. The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.",1,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

When I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. 

I ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.

I think the little splash park is big fun for younger children, although it can get quite crowded and there are, as always, those parents who do not monitor their children's behavior.

Some of the desserts are really over priced for the quality and quantity you are getting (i.e. Small Almond croissant $4.20) 


Today I ordered an Early Grey. The earl grey tea I had tasted moldy .... It also made me sick.... Which makes me question what type of hygiene they have there. 



Will not be going back to this place ever .... They are a disgrace to cafes.

I was between 4 and 5 stars and the reason I went with 4 stars is because I paid $18 on Wednesday night for two Bud Lights.... and I think that is ridiculous.  And I am not a fan of the VIP seating they had on the second level for the Willie Nelson concert... it took up way too much room, making the venue feel a little overcrowded.  These seats were not there for the Black Crowes or Five for Fighting and I prefer them not to be there the next time I am lucky enough to take in a show here.

The bathrooms are great here, which is an added bonus and a surprise!

This venue is fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show.  Really, Willie was spectacular and I loved the small venue for such a big man.  It makes it nearly impossible to think of going to a coliseum/arena event.

Well, add to all of that, that the food is delicious. Maizal is a recent addition to the Liberty Village area. They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan/veg ones.

The menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)

Other things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. 

Outdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.

We each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)

The fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours. Add some of the pico and a touch of lettuce and it is perfection. The folks at Maizal are doing exciting things with food, and I'm looking forward to seeing more, and eating much more from them.

I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it.

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.

Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.

Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.

Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.

I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me.

However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.

I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.

People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.

And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up.

The indoor pool area is great, with shower facilities and a locker room that are clean and a good temperature for freezing kids getting out of the pool.  The pool is an Olympic sized pool and is not kept freezing (like at MAC) but is cool enough for the children not to overheat.  The deep end has a ledge around the sides that the children can stand on while receiving instruction.  There are several diving blocks they practice on as well.  The seating is great... concrete bleacher-like seating that is in the pool area and divided by a smallish wall.  While the area does have a strong chlorine smell, it is nothing like other area YMCAs that have the indoor pools and water parks... my eyes do not sting while there nor do my clothes smell when we leave.  And, while it is warm in there (thank Goodness!), it is not sweltering.  The parking is awesome here.  There is never a crowd.

Ok, on to the instruction, which is great... I have enrolled a 4 year old and a 9 year old in this program.  My 4 year old could doggie paddle and swim just well enough to jump off the diving board, my 9 year old needed a refresher for the swim team and was mostly doing ""illegal"" strokes that would get her disqualified in a meet.  The lessons are at 6 week intervals, which is nice as really long-term commitments freak me out a bit (commitment phobe!).  They are so reasonably prices compared to what we have paid at the stand alone swim centers, I almost felt guilty.  This guilt increased when I found that my 9 year old was in a class with only one other child. The instructor was fantastic!  He pushed them enough to work hard but feel accomplished.  And he got her strokes totally straightened out (no more lifting her head to take a breath in freestyle).  We did 2 sessions (one 6 weeks, the other 5 weeks (even better for my commitment issues)), and my daughter ended up in the All Star swim meet after summer swim team.  Which was a bonus, I just did not want her to be embarrassed swimming.  The 4 year old?  After one 6 week session, she was doing a version of freestyle, jumping off the diving board and I felt totally safe letting her swim this summer without having to be in the pool with her at every moment.

164,Egn5h9fStvVKcFH7kaLQig,1,2013-04-27,1,We853schI2SMtGPJHYHYtA,3,"3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.

3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).

One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.

Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.

But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.

Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.

If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.

With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.

Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.

No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.

The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon.

126,pgomg_u3H2RtEVUYUcngXQ,1,2012-03-21,2,lWZbF7GrYb8YFne_HN7m0w,3,"I heart churros.  At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all ""I heart"" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.

Pancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.

It was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.

Full of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.

The churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.

We started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.

Later at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.

The bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.

Now I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do ""heart"" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

120,wVc3g-YfyDvkOLDecpr4DA,0,2012-03-16,0,RCTkfcQKczfUhtV1Hz58jA,5,"5 Doors North is my neighbourhood spot. I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.

A spur of the moment, ""Thursday night out"" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.

The wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.

The appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.

For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.

The braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.

The prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.",7,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

137,43PeF0ERpSIiEbXM6f9N2g,1,2011-06-26,1,o3cfKu_O1n8CiJpFdjVvsA,3,"Geez. I just cant figure it out. I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.

The big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. 

Once you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.

The inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.

Unfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.

I'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.",2,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

Mr Greek has slid to becoming nothing more than a glorified cafeteria. That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.

I remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto. Add in the sweaty, pushy serving staff, and you have an all around poor dining experience.

I actually complained via email last time I went, and I promptly received an email back from the owner full of profuse apologies and promises of a better meal, nicer service and an overall better experience if I returned. Although I appreciated his effort, the last thing I want is to be forced another meal there. I know restaurants can have a bad day, and I'm willing to overlook that. But from what I saw, this was just another day in the life of crappy restaurant living of it's achievements in the distant past.

On a street with as many options as the Danforth, there's absolutley no reason (or excuse!) to end up in this joint.",5,YHWsLBS8jzZiPjKHMFOaAA

The food was fresh and good, although portions were a tad on the small side, so we ended up sharing plates like a tapas bar and kept ordering until we were full. I would definitely go back for more. 

As others have mentioned, you can sit and eat at the bar, which is not a typical bar used to serve customers drinks before they are seated - it is definitely meant for dining and you can even reserve seats at the bar.
